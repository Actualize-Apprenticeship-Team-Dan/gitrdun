# Git R Dun

Git R Dun is a ToDo app on steroids where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks include due dates and user ownership and all data is updated reactively.

### Dependencies

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) | [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

* [React Sortable HOC](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc)

* [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)

* [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/)


### Getting Started

On the command line run:

* `git clone git@github.com:Actualize-Apprenticeship-Team-Dan/gitrdun.git`

* `npm install`

> Since Git R Dun uses Google Firebase for authentication and datastore an API key will be needed to be added to your `.env` file as `REACT_APP_DEV_FIREBASE_KEY=********************`

* `npm start`

> App running at `http://localhost:3000`

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

* Run test suite: `npm test`
